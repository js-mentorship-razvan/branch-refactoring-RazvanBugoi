# Student:

In this assignment, we are going to refactor your notes to get a grasp about the concept of Code Refactoring. You can read more about it [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring](here).

Start a new branch, in your 'javascript' repository and update your notes to include just small chunks of code and just a few notes regarding what they do.

For example:


# Variables:

```(javascript)
let user = "Admin";
const os = "Gnu/Linux";
var mem = true;
```

After you finish with this, merge your newly created branch with the master branch.
